Focus System v2.4

A minimalist, high-integrity Pomodoro and objective-tracking utility designed for sustained cognitive throughput. This system is built to provide a low-friction interface for deep work, aligning personal productivity with systemic restraint.

Philosophy

The Focus System is designed around the principle of quiet competence. Unlike mainstream productivity tools that rely on "gamification" or intrusive notifications, this tool assumes good faith and provides a durable, low-drama environment for serious work.

Assume Good Faith: The system provides the structure; you provide the discipline.

Restraint over Display: Minimalist UI/UX that recedes into the background during active protocols.

Cognitive Integrity: Features like the "Pre-Flight Check" ensure mindset alignment before engagement.

Technical Architecture

The application is a single-file React utility, optimized for both desktop and mobile (PWA) deployment.

Engine: React 18 with Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useRef).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (custom zinc/dark-mode palette).

Icons: Lucide React.

Intelligence: Integration with Gemini 2.5 Flash for dynamic focus protocols and objective breakdown.

Persistence: LocalStorage-based state management (no external database required for initial scale).

Key Features

Adaptive Recommendation Engine: Analyzes session history to suggest whether to engage in Focus, a Short Reset, or a Deep Reset based on "system entropy."

AI Focus Protocols: Generates context-aware, Stoic-inspired mindset prompts based on your current task stack.

Objective Stack: A streamlined task manager with AI-driven "Task Breakdown" capabilities to transform complex goals into actionable micro-steps.

Pre-Flight Check: A mandatory confirmation gate for Focus sessions to ensure physical and digital environments are cleared.

Deployment

The system is optimized for Vercel deployment as a Progressive Web App (PWA):

Push to GitHub.

Connect to Vercel.

On Mobile: "Add to Home Screen" for a standalone, app-like experience.
